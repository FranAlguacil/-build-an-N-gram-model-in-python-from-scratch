STEPS: 
#Use of NLTK and Numpy

1. Preprocess the corpora to remove the punctuations 

2. be able to generate till 5-grams 

3. Create a class: 
                  - training
                  - generation
                  - evaluation

4. build a code to handle n-grams not presented in training data: smoothing

5. build test to check that it works: perplexity

6. Interpolation and back-off strategies: Laplace and absolute discount

6. Try with different corpora: Reuters, ABC, Brown Corpus

7. Comparing the results using different corpora: Comparing section 'news' with each corpus and try with each n-gram architecture

8. Writing a report using graphics and giving explanation
