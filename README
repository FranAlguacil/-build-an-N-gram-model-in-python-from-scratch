STEPS: 


1. Preprocess the corpora to remove the punctuations 

2. Create a function that be able to generate till 5-grams 

3. Create a class: 
                  - training
                  - generation
                  - evaluation

4. build a code to handle n-grams not presented in training data

5. build test to check that it works

6. Try with different corpora, for instansce: 3 or 4 to check how changes with each of them

(3.	The code base should be updated frequently with small pushes.) ?I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS

7. Comparing the results using different corpora

8. Writing a report using graphics and giving explanation
